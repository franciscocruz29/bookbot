# BookBot

BookBot is a simple Python project that analyzes the text of a book to provide insights into its content. It counts the total number of words and calculates the frequency of each character. This tool is designed to be run from the command line and is a great way to get a high-level overview of a book's composition.

## About The Project

This project was developed as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) curriculum. The main goal of BookBot is to showcase basic Python skills, including file I/O, string manipulation, and data structuring. It serves as a practical example of how to build a simple command-line tool for text analysis.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```sh
python --version
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/bookbot.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd bookbot
    ```

## Usage

To use BookBot, run the `main.py` script from the command line, followed by the path to the book file you want to analyze.

```sh
python main.py <path/to/your/book.txt>
```

For example, to analyze the included `frankenstein.txt` book, you would run:

```sh
python main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

This will print a report to the console with the total word count and a breakdown of character frequencies.

## Features

*   **Word Count:** Calculates the total number of words in the provided text file.
*   **Character Frequency:** Counts the occurrences of each character in the text.
*   **Detailed Report:** Generates a clean, easy-to-read report of the analysis.
